INTRODUCTION                                                        *cwdtabline-intro*

This plugin takes over the 'tabline' and renders each tab as the last
component of the cwd of the active window in that tab. For example if the cwd
of the active window in a tab was "~/work/project", then "project" would be
displayed in that tab.

There are currently no configurable aspects to this plugin, just drop it in
and you're done. If you want to always display the tabline then you'd have to
set vim's 'showtabline' to 2.

ALTERED CWD DISPLAY                                               *cwdtabline-display*

This plugin will display a tab sitting in your home directory as "~". Also, for
a string of adjacent tabs which have the same cwd, the leftmost tab will
display the cwd while the others will display ". The thought behind this was to
maximize screen space and to be able to tell at a glance that a group of tabs
are all in the same directory.

There is a plugin for displaying buffers on the tabline:
https://github.com/ap/vim-buftabline. I'd like to modify cwdtabline so these
two plugins can work nicely together. I'm picturing that when there is one tab
then buffers get displayed using buftabline but when there are 2 or more tabs
then cwdtabline takes over. My thought behind this is that for tiny personal
projects you might only be working on a couple files in a single repository and
navigating between files with something like `<C-n>` and `<C-p>` (assuming
they've been remapped to `:bnext` and `:bprev` respectively) might be faster.
But when multiple tabs get used you'd definitely want to see those tabs instead
of buffers.

Just shortly after finishing this plugin I was looking at other tabline
related plugins and learned that tpope's flagship plugin can be used to
customize the tabline AND has built in functionality to display the cwd for
each tab. From what I've seen you can't get the last component of the cwd
which might be fine with me but I wonder what it would take to configure his
plugin to work exactly like mine does.
